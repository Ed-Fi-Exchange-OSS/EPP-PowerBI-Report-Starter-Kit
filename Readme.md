# EPP Power BI Report Starter Kit

The Educator Preparation Program (EPP) Power BI Report Starter Kit repository is meant to be used in conjunction with the [Program Diversity and Persistence Starter Kit](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/display/SK/Program+Diversity+and+Persistence+Starter+Kit) and the [Clinical Experience and Performance Starter Kit](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/display/SK/Clinical+Experience+and+Performance+Starter+Kit) pages in [Ed-Fi Tech Docs](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/)

The EPP Power BI Starter Kit focuses on two use cases and allows EPPs to understand how TPDM data can be modeled and visualized in Power BI.
